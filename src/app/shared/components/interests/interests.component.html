      I am very interested in application design and building web applications, the idea of knowing a little bit about
      this branch of technology, a phrase I heard once, and it helped me a lot said: it is not necessary to know
      everything, if you know how to do a little bit of that, you will be fine, you don't have to be an expert in
      something to know when someone is good at doing it.
      <br>

      That said, you don't have to know everything to lead your team to success.
